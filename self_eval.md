# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?

    **I am 4/5 confident using the built in methods. It's helpful there's already so much documentation a quick search away.**

- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?

    **I am 3/5 confident writing my own methods. I'm still getting the hang of what I want the code block to do and how it will react to the passed arguments.**

- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
    **One question that popped up was when the exercise asked what data type the arguments were. Won't there be multiple data types that can work within the code block?**
